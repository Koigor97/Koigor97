### Hey.. I'm Koigor 😎, nice to meet you 🤝
Samuel is my given name but I like my tribal name more, "Koigor".
It means _**fight the war**_. I was born toward the end of my country's civil war.
I'm a Sierra Leonean from the Republic of Sierra Leone (West Africa).
Home to beautiful people and beaches. As well as home to Idris Elba, Anthony Rudiger and many more.

I am student (online) of 🎓 [Brigham Young University](https://www.byu.edu) through the [BYU PathwayWorldwide Program](https://www.byupathway.org)  
The goal ⚽ is to be a Software Engineer 👨🏾‍💻 and this repository is a timeline of my journey in achieving that goal.  
It houses repositories of programming languages learned, technical skills aquired, and projects built. My degree is in Software Development,  
but my first certificate (on going) is in Web and Computer Programming. However, I do take extra courses that is needed to attain my goal,  
because the tech world is never static, it's always up to something 😆.
