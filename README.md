**Samuel** is my given name but I like my tribal name more, **"Koigor"**.
It means _**fight the war**_. I was born toward the end of my country's civil war.
I'm a Sierra Leonean from the Republic of Sierra Leone (West Africa).
Home to beautiful people and beaches. As well as home to Idris Elba, Anthony Rudiger and many more.

I am student (online) of 🎓 [Brigham Young University](https://www.byu.edu) through the [BYU PathwayWorldwide Program](https://www.byupathway.org)  
The goal ⚽ is to be a Software Engineer 👨🏾‍💻 and this repository is a timeline of my journey in achieving that goal.  
It houses repositories of programming languages learned, technical skills aquired, and projects built. My degree is in Software Development - and it's a Certificate-First structure. My first certificate (on going) is in Web and Computer Programming. However, I do take extra courses that is needed to attain my goal, because the tech world is never static, it's always up to something 😆.
